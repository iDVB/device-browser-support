Device / Browser Support
========================

A well-cited position of Device and Browser Support


## Position
- [**Mobile First Approach**](http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/web/mobile-first-responsive-web-design/)
  - Semantic HTML and CSS
- [**Graded Browser Support**](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Graded-Browser-Support#three-grades-of-support)
  - Support for Grade-C Browsers (IE6-8) is supported by device detecting for the sole purpose of providing a minimal HTML content only experience without JS, CSS or Polyfils.
  - Support for NO-JS should be limited and should fundamentally provide users with recommendation to seek an device with support for full site experience.
  - Security is #1. Even without JS (client-side validation) the servers application must ensure proper validation is performed. This document's position is only suggesting that the UX experience is limited to something like a [suggestion to enable JS](http://www.screencast.com/t/01gSvaH0IfW).
- [**Progressive Enhancement**](http://alistapart.com/article/understandingprogressiveenhancement)
  - Minimize usage of Polyfills and Shims where usage should be limited to low impact support for Grade-C Browsers


## No JS Support - Additional Cost Examples
- [**Map and GPS**](http://goo.gl/JUp1h1)
  - **Basic Support:** When a user visits a site where the device/browser does not support [Geolocation API](http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source.html) the user is prompted to manually type in their current location and hit enter to see the map results.
  - **Progressive Enhancement**: When a user visits a site where the device/browser DOES support [Geolocation API](http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source.html) the site auto locates them, prefills their search field and provides results. (User Approval Prompt Required)
    - This is considered true progressive enhancement support. Notice there are no steps taken to attempt to provide the enhanced features to the browsers that do not support them.
- [**Quick Search**](http://goo.gl/lpWIJy)
  - **WITH JS**: As a user types in a search query into the field, results are dynamically displayed (AJAX), sorted and filtered as they type directly under the field. The backend is responding to the request with properly sorted, filtered results via **JSON**.
  - **W/O JS**: As a user types in a search query into the field, results are  NOT displayed until they click the search button (which is no longer hidden). The backend is responding to the request with properly sorted, filtered results via **HTML** and as part of the "Search Results" page template.
- [**Basic Form**](http://goo.gl/JUp1h1)


## Important Libraries
- [**Monderizr.js**](http://modernizr.com/)
  - Modernizr is a JavaScript library that detects HTML5 and CSS3 features in the userâ€™s browser.
  - Feature Detection vs Device Detection
  - Eg. HTML5 Video (ogg, webm and h264)
- [**Respond.js**](https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond)
  - A fast & lightweight polyfill for [CSS3 Media Queries](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/)
  - CON: Turning off JS will break Responsiveness
- [**Selectivizr.js**](http://selectivizr.com/)
  - CSS3 Pseudo-Classes and Attribute Selectors Polyfil
  - CON: turning off JS will break CSS layouts
- [**Picturefill**](https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill)
  - A [responsive image](http://picture.responsiveimages.org/) polyfill.
